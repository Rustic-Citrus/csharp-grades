## Introduction

A simple application in C# designed to show the grades of four students in table format. The test scores of the students are inserted as arrays of integers. Next, the average test score is calculated and assigned to a letter grade, based on a pre-determined grading system. Finally, the table is written to the console in the correct format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Microsoft .NET Framework is installed on your computer. You can download it by clicking on this [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework).

### Setup

1. Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory where you want the project to stored. In Bash, this can be done with the command `cd`:

    `cd path\to\directory`

2. Next, clone the repository to your current working directory.

    `git clone `

3. Navigate into the project directory.

    `cd csharp-grades`

4. To run the C# program, you must pass one of two possible arguments. 

    1. To run the Gradebook application, type:

        `dotnet run -- gradebook`

    2. To run the GPA application, type:

        `dotnet run -- gpa`


## Background

This application was a collection of guided projects from Microsoft Learn. You can find more information about the steps that I followed below:

1. [Guided project - Calculate and print student grades](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/guided-project-calculate-print-student-grades/)
2. [Guided project - Calculate final GPA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/guided-project-calculate-final-gpa/)

You will notice that I have applied some concepts, such as arrays, that are not covered in the basic course. I decided to create a more elegant solution than the one suggested. I already had some background knowledge in Python and JavaScript, and I wanted to test my understanding further.
